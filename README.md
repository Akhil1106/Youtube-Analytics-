Predicting videos from comment information.

Topic Modelling to extract the various topic by following the pattern like clustering

Business Value for our Project:
By using four carefully crafted evaluation criteria, including appearance frequency, like-to- dislike ratio, growth pace, and sentiment polarity, 
we will assist them in identifying the most popular and trending channels. The intention is for advertisers to choose to get into contracts with these 
channel owners in order to generate revenue. Additionally, they can select these YouTube channels to check if potential clients match the qualities of their items. 
For instance, we saw that "Marques Brownley" has been consistently trending this month. We looked up his channel and discovered that he is the most promising and well-liked 
technology youtuber in the United States, with a very strong and distinctive sense of style. He has grabbed
worldwide attention through his tech-videos.
